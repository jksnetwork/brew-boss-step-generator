# Brew-Boss Step Generator

This is a little generator I put together to make it easier to modify the step files that the Brew Boss software uses during a brew session.  

Features:
* Import existing step files to edit them.
* Export step files to Brew Boss stp format.
* Move and re-order rows within the step file.


To use this generator you can either import a step file from your Brew Boss application or modify the default one that is included.  Once the step file is complete it can be saved to later be imported into the Brew Boss software on the tablet.  For Android, I use an app called AirDroid to transfer the files to the tablet.
